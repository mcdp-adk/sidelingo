## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs live in GitHub Issues for `mcdp-adk/sidelingo`, managed with the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Uses the five default triage labels: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Invariants

- Changes reach `main` through a PR unless the owner asks for a direct commit.
- Every ticked acceptance criterion has evidence, and an issue closes only with every criterion ticked.
- A PR for an issue starts with `Closes #N` when it finishes the issue, or `Refs #N` when it doesn't.
- A PR that changes code merges only after `pnpm test:e2e` passes locally, with the run shown in the PR; CI can't run the suite.
